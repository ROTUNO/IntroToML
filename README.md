This repository contains my Intro to Machine Learning assignment, which explores a binary classification problem involving loan default prediction. The goal is to apply fundamental ML concepts to a real-world dataset and demonstrate how different models handle imbalanced data.
**Problem**
Predict whether a loan will default using customer and loan information.
**Approach**
Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
o	Applied balancing techniques to handle class imbalance once, then reused the balanced data across models.
o	Trained and compared three classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
o	Evaluated models to find the best estimator.
**Technologies Used**
•	Python (Jupyter Notebook exported as HTML)
•	Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
**Contents**
•	IntroToML.html – Full notebook with code, EDA, model training, and results.
•	Supporting scripts or data can be added if needed.

This task strengthened my understanding of: - Dealing with imbalanced datasets. - Consistent preprocessing for fair model comparison. - Model selection and evaluation metrics for classification.
