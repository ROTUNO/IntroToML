ðŸ“Š Introduction to Machine Learning: Loan Default Prediction
This repository contains my Intro to Machine Learning assignment, which explores a binary classification problem involving loan default prediction. The goal is to apply fundamental ML concepts to a real-world dataset and demonstrate how different models handle imbalanced data.
âœ¨ Project Highlights
â€¢	Problem: Predict whether a loan will default using customer and loan information.
â€¢	Approach:
o	Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

o	Applied balancing techniques to handle class imbalance once, then reused the balanced data across models.
o	Trained and compared three classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
o	Evaluated models to find the best estimator.
ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
â€¢	Python (Jupyter Notebook exported as HTML)
â€¢	Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
ðŸ“‚ Contents
â€¢	IntroToML.html â€“ Full notebook with code, EDA, model training, and results.
â€¢	Supporting scripts or data can be added if needed.
âœ… What I Learned
This task strengthened my understanding of: - Dealing with imbalanced datasets. - Consistent preprocessing for fair model comparison. - Model selection and evaluation metrics for classification.
